Before Breakfast
HERE'S Papa going with that ax?"
said Fern to her mother as they
were setting the table for breakfast.
"Out to the hoghouse," replied
Mrs. Arable. "Some pigs were born last night."
"I don't see why he needs an ax," continued Fern,
who was only eight.
"Well," said her mother, "one of the pigs is a runt.
It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to
anything. So your father has decided to do away with
it."
"Do away with it?" shrieked Fern. "You mean kill
it? Just because it's smaller than the others?"
Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table.
"Don't yell, Fern!" she said. "Your father is right. The
pig would probably die anyway."
Fern pushed a chair out of the way and ran outdoors.
The grass was wet and the earth smelled of springtime.
Fern's sneakers were sopping by the time she caught
up. with her father. 

"Please don't kill it!" she sobbed. "It's unfair."
Mr. Arable stopped walking.
"Fern," he said gently, "you will have to learn to
control yourself."
"Control myself?" yelled F em. "This is a matter of
life and death, and you talk about controlling myself." 


Before Breakfast 3
Tears ran down her cheeks and she took hold of the ax
and tried to pull it out of her father's hand.
"Fern," said Mr. Arable, "I know more about raising
a litter of pigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble.
Now run along!"
"But it's unfair," cried Fern. "The pig couldn't help
being born small, could it? If I had been very small at
birth, would you have killed me?"
Mr. Arable smiled. "Certainly not," he said, looking
down at his daughter with love. "But this is different.
A little girl is one thing, a little runty pig is another."
"I see no difference," replied Fern, still hanging on
to the ax. "This is the most terrible case of injustice I
ever heard of."
A queer look came over John Arable's face. He
seemed almost ready to cry himself.
"All right," he said. "You go back to the house and
I will bring the runt when I come in. I'll let you start
it on a bottle, like a baby. Then you'll see what trouble
a pig can be."
When Mr. Arable returned to the house half an
hour later, he carried a carton under his arm. Fern was
upstairs changing her sneakers. The kitchen table was
set for breakfast, and the room smelled of coffee, bacon,
damp plaster, and wood smoke from the stove.
"Put it on her chair!" said Mrs. Arable. Mr. Arable
set the carton down at Fern's place. Then he walked 
4 Charlotte's Web
to the sink and washed his hands and dried them on the
roller towel.
Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were
red from crying. As she approached her chair, the
carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise. F em
looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton.
There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn
pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone
through its ears, turning them pink.
"He's yours," said Mr. Arable. "Saved from an untimely
death. And may the good Lord forgive me for
this foolishness."
Fern couldn't take her eyes off the tiny pig. "Oh,"
she whispered. "Oh, look at him! He's absolutely perfect."

She closed the canon carefully. First she kissed her
father, then she kissed her mother. Then she opened
the lid again, lifted the pig out, and held it against


specimen of a pig-it's no bigger than a white rat."
"Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery!" said his
mother. "The school bus will be along in half an hour."
"Can I have a pig, too, Pop?" asked Avery.
"No, I only distribute pigs to early risers," said Mr.
Arable. "F em was up at daylight, trying to rid the
world of injustice. As a result, she now has a pig. A
small one, to be sure, but nevertheless a pig. It just
shows what can happen if a person gets out of bed
promptly. Let's eat!"
But Fern couldn't eat until her pig had had a drink
of milk. Mrs. Arable found a baby's nursing bottle and
a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, 

fitted the nipple over the top, and handed it to Fern.
"Give him his breakfast!" she said.
A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the
comer of the kitchen with her infant between her 
Before Breakfast 7
knees, teaching it to suck from the bottle. The pig,
although tiny, had a good appetite and caught on
quickly.
The school bus honked from the road.
"Run!" commanded Mrs. Arable, taking the pig
from Fern and slipping a doughnut into her hand.
Avery grabbed his gun and another doughnut.
The children ran out to the road and climbed into
the bus. Fern took no notice of the others in the bus.
She just sat and stared out of the window, thinking
what a blissful world it was and how lucky she was to
have entire charge of a pig. By the time the bus reached
school, F em had named her pet, selecting the most
beautiful name she could think of.
"Its name is Wilbur," she whispered to herself.
She was still thinking about the pig when the teacher
said: "Fern, what is the capital of Pennsylvania?"
"Wilbur," replied Fern, dreamily. The pupils giggled.
F em blushed. 
Chapter II
Wilbur 
her cheek. At this moment her brother A very came
into the room. A very was ten. He was heavily armed
-an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the
other.
"What's that?" he demanded. "What's Fern got?"
11She's got a guest for breakfast," said Mrs. Arable.
11Wash your hands and face, Avery!"
"Let's see it!" said Avery, setting his gun down.
uy ou call that miserable thing a pig? That's a fine 






--	One by one the stars went out. Wilbur could see the
--goose a few feet away. She sat with head tucked under
--a wing. Then he could see the sheep and the lambs. The
--sky lightened.
--"Oh, beautiful day, it is here at last! Today I shall
--find my friend."

--Wilbur looked everywhere. He searched his pen
--thoroughly. He examined the window ledge, stared up
--at the ceiling. But he saw nothing new. Finally he decided
--he would have to speak up. He hated to break the
--lovely stillness of dawn by using his voice, but he
--couldn't think of any other way to locate the mysterious
--new friend who was nowhere to be seen. So Wilbur
--cleared his throat.
--"Attention, please!" he said in a loud, finn voice.
--"Will the party who addressed me at bedtime last night
--kindly make himself or herself known by giving an
--appropriate sign or signal!"

--Wilbur paused and listened. All the other animals
--lifted their heads and stared at him. Wilbur blushed.
--But he was determined to get in touch with his unknown
--friend.

--"Attention, please!" he said. "I will repeat the message.
--Will the party who addressed me at bedtime last
--night kindly speak up. Please tell me where you are, if
--you are my friend!"
--The sheep looked at each other in disgust.


--"Stop your nonsense, Wilbur!" said the oldest sheep.
--"If you have a new friend here, you are probably disturbing
--his rest; and the quickest way to spoil a friendship
--is to wake somebody up in the morning before he
--is ready. How can you be sure your friend is an early
--riser? "


--"I beg everyone's pardon," whispered Wilbur. "I
--didn't mean to be objectionable."
--He lay down meekly in the manure, facing the door.

--He did not know it, but his friend was very near. And
--the old sheep was right-the friend was still asleep.


--Soon Lurvy appeared with slops for breakfast. Wilbur
--rushed out, ate everything in a hurry, and licked
--the trough. The sheep moved off down the lane, the
--gander waddled along behind them, pulling grass. And
--then, just as Wilbur was settling down for his morning
--nap, he heard again the thin voice that had addressed
--him the night before.



--"Salutations!" said the voice.
--Wilbur jumped to his feet. "Salu-what?" he cried.


--"Salutations!" repeated the voice.
--"What are they, and where are you? " screamed Wilbur.
--"Please, please, tell me where you are. And what
--are salutations? "


--"Salutations are greetings," said the voice. "When I
--say 'salutations,' it's just my fancy way of saying hello
--or good morning. Actually, it's a silly expression, and



--I am surprised that I used it at all. As for my whereabouts,
--that's easy. Look up here in the corner of the
--doorway! Here I am. Look, I'm waving!"
--At last Wilbur saw the creature that had spoken to
--him in such a kindly way. Stretched across the upper
--part of the doorway was a big spiderweb, and hanging

--========== 1. =======

--from the top of the web, head down, was a large grey
--spider. She was about the size of a gumdrop. She had
--eight legs, and she was waving one of them at Wilbur
--in friendly greeting. "See me now? " she asked.
--"Oh, yes indeed," said Wilbur. "Yes indeed! How
--are you? Good morning! Salutations! Very pleased to
--meet you. What is your name, please? May I have your
--name?"



--"My name," said the spider, "is Charlotte."
--"Charlotte what?" asked Wilbur, eagerly.
--"Charlotte A. Cavatica. But just call me Charlotte."
--"I think you're beautiful," said Wilbur.
--"Well, I am pretty," replied Charlotte. "There's no
--denying that. Almost all spiders are rather nice-looking.

--I'm not as flashy as some, but I'll do. I wish I could see
--you, Wilbur, as clearly as you can see me."


--"Why can't you?" asked the pig. "I'm right here."
--"Yes, but I'm near-sighted," replied Charlotte. "I've
--always been dreadfully near-sighted. It's good in some
--ways, not so good in others. Watch me wrap up this
--fly."


--A fly that had been crawling along Wilbur's trough
--had flown up and blundered into the lower part of
--Charlotte's web and was tangled in the sticky threads.
--The fly was beating its wings furiously, trying to break
--loose and free itself.


--"First," said Charlotte, "I dive at him." She plunged

--headfirst toward the fly. As she dropped, a tiny silken
--thread unwound from her rear end.


--"Next, I wrap him up." She grabbed the fly, threw
--a few jets of silk around it, and rolled it over and over,
--wrapping it so that it couldn't move. Wilbur watched
--in horror. He could hardly believe what he was seeing,
--and although he detested flies, he was sorry for this one.


--"There!" said Charlotte. "Now I knock him out, so
--he'll be more comfortable." She bit the fly. "He can't
--feel a thing now," she remarked. "He'll make a perfect
--breakfast for me."


--====================================== 2. =========================================
--"You mean you eat flies?" gasped Wilbur.
--''Certainly. Flies, bugs, grasshoppers, choice beedes,
--moths, butterflies, tasty cockroaches, gnats, midges,
--daddy longlegs, centipedes, mosquitoes, crickets-'.Ulything
--that is careless enough to get caught in my web.
--I have to live, don't I?"
--"Why, yes, of course," said Wilbur. "Do they taste
--good?"



--"Delicious. Of course, I don't really eat them. I drink
--them-drink their blood. I love blood, " said Charlotte,
--and her pleasant, thin voice grew even thinner and more
--pleasant.



--"Don't say that!" groaned Wilbur. "Please don't say
--things like that!"
--"Why not? It's true, and I have to say what is true.
--I am not entirely happy about my diet of flies and bugs,

--but it's the way I'm made. A spider has to pick up a
--living somehow or other, and I happen to be a trapper.

--I just naturally build a web and trap flies and other insects.
--My mother was a trapper before me. Her mother
--was a trapper before her. All our family have been trappers.

--Way back for thousands and thousands of years
--we spiders have been laying for flies and bugs."

--"It's a miserable inheritance," said Wilbur, gloomily.
--He was sad because his new friend was so bloodthirsty.

--"Yes, it is," agreed Charlotte. "But I can't help it. I
--don't know how the first spider in the early days of the


--world happened to think up this fancy idea of spinning
--a web, but she did, and it was clever of her, too. And
--since then, all of us spiders have had to work the same
--trick. It's not a bad pitch, on the whole. "
--"It's cruel, " replied Wilbur, who did not intend to
--be argued out of his position.


--"Well, you can't talk" said Charlotte. "You have
--your meals brought to you in a pail. Nobody feeds me.
--I have to get my own living. I live by my wits. I have to
--be sharp and clever, lest I go hungry. I have to think
--things out, catch what I can, take what comes. And it
--just so happens, my friend, that what comes is flies and
--insects and bugs. And furthermore," said Charlotte,


--shaking one of her legs, "do you realize that if I didn't
--catch bugs and eat them, bugs would increase and multiply
--and get so numerous that they'd destroy the earth,
--wipe out everything?"


--"Really?" said Wilbur. "I wouldn't want that to happen.
--Perhaps your web is a good thing after all."


--The goose had been listening to this conversation and
--chuckling to herself. "There are a lot of things Wilbur
--doesn't know about life," she thought. "He's really a
--very innocent little pig. He doesn't even know what's


--going to happen to him around Christmastime; he has
--no idea that Mr. Zuckerman and Lurvy are plotting to
--kill him." And the goose raised herself a bit and poked
--her eggs a little further under her so that they would

--receive the full heat from her wann body and soft
--feathers.
--Charlotte stood quietly over the fly, preparing to eat
--it. Wilbur lay down and closed his eyes. He was tired
--from his wakeful night and from the excitement of
--meeting someone for the first time. A breeze brought
--him the smell of clover-the sweet-smelling world beyond
--his fence. "Well," he thought, "I've got a new


--friend, all right. But what a gamble friendship is! Charlotte
--is fierce, brutal, scheming, bloodthirsty-everything
--I don't like. How can I learn to like her, even
--though she is pretty and, of course, clever?"


--Wilbur was merely suffering the doubts and fears
--that often go with finding a new friend. In good time
--he was to discover that he was mistaken about Charlotte.
--Underneath her rather bold and cruel exterior,
--she had a kind heart, and she was to prove loyal and
--true to the very end.

¡GI am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,¡F said Holmes, as we sat down together to our breakfast one morning.

¡GGo! Where to?¡F

¡GTo Dartmoor; to King?s Pyland.¡F

I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favorite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only what I had both expected and hoped for.

¡GI should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in the way,¡F said I.

¡GMy dear Watson, you would confer a great favor upon me by coming. And I think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about the case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent field-glass.¡F

And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had left Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.

¡GWe are going well,¡F said he, looking out the window and glancing at his watch. ¡GOur rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.¡F

¡GI have not observed the quarter-mile posts,¡F said I.

¡GNor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that you have looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?¡F

¡GI have seen what the Telegraph and the Chronicle have to say.¡F

¡GIt is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and of such personal importance to so many people, that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis. The difficulty is to detach the framework of factXof absolute undeniable factXfrom the embellishments of theorists and reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns. On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross, the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the case, inviting my cooperation.¡F

¡GTuesday evening!¡F I exclaimed. ¡GAnd this is Thursday morning. Why didn?t you go down yesterday?¡F

¡GBecause I made a blunder, my dear WatsonXwhich is, I am afraid, a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been wasted.¡F

¡GYou have formed a theory, then?¡F

¡GAt least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we start.¡F

I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while Holmes, leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the events which had led to our journey.

¡GSilver Blaze,¡F said he, ¡Gis from the Somomy stock, and holds as brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the catastrophe he was the first favorite for the Wessex Cup, the betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a prime favorite with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that there were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next Tuesday.

¡GThe fact was, of course, appreciated at King?s Pyland, where the Colonel?s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken to guard the favorite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired jockey who rode in Colonel Ross?s colors before he became too heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel for five years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable, while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.

¡GOn that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o?clock. Two of the lads walked up to the trainer?s house, where they had supper in the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very dark and the path ran across the open moor.

¡GEdith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a gray suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed, however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty than under it.

¡G?Can you tell me where I am?? he asked. ¡DI had almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.?

¡G?You are close to the King?s Pyland training-stables,? said she.

¡G?Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!? he cried. ¡DI understand that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?? He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his waistcoat pocket. ¡DSee that the boy has this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.?

¡GShe was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand the meals. It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had happened, when the stranger came up again.

¡G?Good-evening,? said he, looking through the window. ¡DI wanted to have a word with you.? The girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand.

¡G?What business have you here?? asked the lad.

¡G?It?s business that may put something into your pocket,? said the other. ¡DYou?ve two horses in for the Wessex CupXSilver Blaze and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won?t be a loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put their money on him??

¡G?So, you?re one of those damned touts!? cried the lad. ¡DI?ll show you how we serve them in King?s Pyland.? He sprang up and rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however, when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.¡F

¡GOne moment,¡F I asked. ¡GDid the stable-boy, when he ran out with the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?¡F

¡GExcellent, Watson, excellent!¡F murmured my companion. ¡GThe importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to get through.

¡GHunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.

¡GMrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside, huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favorite?s stall was empty, and there were no signs of his trainer.

¡GThe two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the house, from which all the neighboring moors were visible, they not only could see no signs of the missing favorite, but they perceived something which warned them that they were in the presence of a tragedy.

¡GAbout a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker?s overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear, however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognized by the maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the stables. Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman. As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same dish on the same night without any ill effect.

¡GThose are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise, and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what the police have done in the matter.

¡GInspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been registered by him against the favorite. On being arrested he volunteered that statement that he had come down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about the King?s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second favorite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed. On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the state of Straker?s knife would show that one at least of his assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be infinitely obliged to you.¡F

I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to each other.

¡GIs it not possible,¡F I suggested, ¡Gthat the incised wound upon Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury?¡F

¡GIt is more than possible; it is probable,¡F said Holmes. ¡GIn that case one of the main points in favor of the accused disappears.¡F

¡GAnd yet,¡F said I, ¡Geven now I fail to understand what the theory of the police can be.¡F

¡GI am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections to it,¡F returned my companion. ¡GThe police imagine, I take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued. Simpson beat out the trainer?s brains with his heavy stick without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker used in self-defense, and then the thief either led the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than our present position.¡F

It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock, which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the stationXthe one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small, alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service.

¡GI am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,¡F said the Colonel. ¡GThe Inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.¡F

¡GHave there been any fresh developments?¡F asked Holmes.

¡GI am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,¡F said the Inspector. ¡GWe have an open carriage outside, and as you would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we drive.¡F

A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection. Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.

¡GThe net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,¡F he remarked, ¡Gand I believe myself that he is our man. At the same time I recognize that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and that some new development may upset it.¡F

¡GHow about Straker?s knife?¡F

¡GWe have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall.¡F

¡GMy friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.¡F

¡GUndoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great interest in the disappearance of the favorite. He lies under suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead man?s hand. I really think we have enough to go before a jury.¡F

Holmes shook his head. ¡GA clever counsel would tear it all to rags,¡F said he. ¡GWhy should he take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable-boy?¡F

¡GHe says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away. The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.¡F

¡GWhat does he say about the cravat?¡F

¡GHe acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stable.¡F

Holmes pricked up his ears.

¡GWe have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have him now?¡F

¡GIt is certainly possible.¡F

¡GThe moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.¡F

¡GThere is another training-stable quite close, I understand?¡F

¡GYes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of the favorite. Silas Brown, the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.¡F

¡GAnd nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of the Mapleton stables?¡F

¡GNothing at all.¡F

Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased. A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road. Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long gray-tiled out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the moor, bronze-colored from the fading ferns, stretched away to the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage.
a horse

¡GExcuse me,¡F said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at him in some surprise. ¡GI was day-dreaming.¡F There was a gleam in his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.

¡GPerhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime, Mr. Holmes?¡F said Gregory.

¡GI think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I presume?¡F

¡GYes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.¡F

¡GHe has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?¡F

¡GI have always found him an excellent servant.¡F

¡GI presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?¡F

¡GI have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would care to see them.¡F

¡GI should be very glad.¡F We all filed into the front room and sat round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A D P brier-root pipe, a pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an aluminum pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co., London.

¡GThis is a very singular knife,¡F said Holmes, lifting it up and examining it minutely. ¡GI presume, as I see blood-stains upon it, that it is the one which was found in the dead man?s grasp. Watson, this knife is surely in your line?¡F

¡GIt is what we call a cataract knife,¡F said I.

¡GI thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.¡F

¡GThe tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his body,¡F said the Inspector. ¡GHis wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hands on at the moment.¡F

¡GVery possible. How about these papers?¡F

¡GThree of them are receipted hay-dealers? accounts. One of them is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a milliner?s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs. Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband?s and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.¡F

¡GMadam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,¡F remarked Holmes, glancing down the account. ¡GTwenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a single costume. However there appears to be nothing more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.¡F

As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the Inspector?s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager, stamped with the print of a recent horror.

¡GHave you got them? Have you found them?¡F she panted.

¡GNo, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to help us, and we shall do all that is possible.¡F

¡GSurely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time ago, Mrs. Straker?¡F said Holmes.

¡GNo, sir; you are mistaken.¡F

¡GDear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of dove-colored silk with ostrich-feather trimming.¡F

¡GI never had such a dress, sir,¡F answered the lady.

¡GAh, that quite settles it,¡F said Holmes. And with an apology he followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had been hung.

¡GThere was no wind that night, I understand,¡F said Holmes.

¡GNone; but very heavy rain.¡F

¡GIn that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush, but placed there.¡F

¡GYes, it was laid across the bush.¡F

¡GYou fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since Monday night.¡F

¡GA piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have all stood upon that.¡F

¡GExcellent.¡F

¡GIn this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy Simpson?s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.¡F

¡GMy dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!¡F Holmes took the bag, and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him. ¡GHullo!¡F said he, suddenly. ¡GWhat?s this?¡F It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.

¡GI cannot think how I came to overlook it,¡F said the Inspector, with an expression of annoyance.

¡GIt was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was looking for it.¡F

¡GWhat! You expected to find it?¡F

¡GI thought it not unlikely.¡F

He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and bushes.

¡GI am afraid that there are no more tracks,¡F said the Inspector. ¡GI have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.¡F

¡GIndeed!¡F said Holmes, rising. ¡GI should not have the impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that I may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this horseshoe into my pocket for luck.¡F

Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my companion?s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch. ¡GI wish you would come back with me, Inspector,¡F said he. ¡GThere are several points on which I should like your advice, and especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove our horse?s name from the entries for the Cup.¡F

¡GCertainly not,¡F cried Holmes, with decision. ¡GI should let the name stand.¡F

The Colonel bowed. ¡GI am very glad to have had your opinion, sir,¡F said he. ¡GYou will find us at poor Straker?s house when you have finished your walk, and we can drive together into Tavistock.¡F

He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who was sunk in the deepest thought.

¡GIt?s this way, Watson,¡F said he at last. ¡GWe may leave the question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now, supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature. If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return to King?s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is clear.¡F

¡GWhere is he, then?¡F

¡GI have already said that he must have gone to King?s Pyland or to Mapleton. He is not at King?s Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the point where we should look for his tracks.¡F

We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes? request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.

¡GSee the value of imagination,¡F said Holmes. ¡GIt is the one quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves justified. Let us proceed.¡F

We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his face. A man?s track was visible beside the horse?s.

¡GThe horse was alone before,¡F I cried.

¡GQuite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?¡F

The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of King?s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back again in the opposite direction.

¡GOne for you, Watson,¡F said Holmes, when I pointed it out. ¡GYou have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on our own traces. Let us follow the return track.¡F

We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led up to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a groom ran out from them.

¡GWe don?t want any loiterers about here,¡F said he.

¡GI only wished to ask a question,¡F said Holmes, with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. ¡GShould I be too early to see your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o?clock to-morrow morning?¡F

¡GBless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.¡F

As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.

¡GWhat?s this, Dawson!¡F he cried. ¡GNo gossiping! Go about your business! And you, what the devil do you want here?¡F

¡GTen minutes? talk with you, my good sir,¡F said Holmes in the sweetest of voices.

¡GI?ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no stranger here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.¡F

Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer?s ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.

¡GIt?s a lie!¡F he shouted, ¡Gan infernal lie!¡F

¡GVery good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your parlor?¡F

¡GOh, come in if you wish to.¡F

Holmes smiled. ¡GI shall not keep you more than a few minutes, Watson,¡F said he. ¡GNow, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.¡F

It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into grays before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too, and he cringed along at my companion?s side like a dog with its master.

¡GYour instructions will be done. It shall all be done,¡F said he.

¡GThere must be no mistake,¡F said Holmes, looking round at him. The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.

¡GOh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I change it first or not?¡F

Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. ¡GNo, don?t,¡F said he; ¡GI shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, orX¡F

¡GOh, you can trust me, you can trust me!¡F

¡GYes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.¡F He turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the other held out to him, and we set off for King?s Pyland.

¡GA more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,¡F remarked Holmes as we trudged along together.

¡GHe has the horse, then?¡F

¡GHe tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced that I was watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly corresponded to them. Again, of course no subordinate would have dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor. How he went out to it, and his astonishment at recognizing, from the white forehead which has given the favorite its name, that chance had put in his power the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead him back to King?s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led it back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.¡F

¡GBut his stables had been searched?¡F

¡GOh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.¡F

¡GBut are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?¡F

¡GMy dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.¡F

¡GColonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to show much mercy in any case.¡F

¡GThe matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the advantage of being unofficial. I don?t know whether you observed it, Watson, but the Colonel?s manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement at his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.¡F

¡GCertainly not without your permission.¡F

¡GAnd of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the question of who killed John Straker.¡F

¡GAnd you will devote yourself to that?¡F

¡GOn the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.¡F

I was thunderstruck by my friend?s words. We had only been a few hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at the trainer?s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting us in the parlor.

¡GMy friend and I return to town by the night-express,¡F said Holmes. ¡GWe have had a charming little breath of your beautiful Dartmoor air.¡F

The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel?s lip curled in a sneer.

¡GSo you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,¡F said he.

Holmes shrugged his shoulders. ¡GThere are certainly grave difficulties in the way,¡F said he. ¡GI have every hope, however, that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photograph of Mr. John Straker?¡F

The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.

¡GMy dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should like to put to the maid.¡F

¡GI must say that I am rather disappointed in our London consultant,¡F said Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the room. ¡GI do not see that we are any further than when he came.¡F

¡GAt least you have his assurance that your horse will run,¡F said I.

¡GYes, I have his assurance,¡F said the Colonel, with a shrug of his shoulders. ¡GI should prefer to have the horse.¡F

I was about to make some reply in defense of my friend when he entered the room again.

¡GNow, gentlemen,¡F said he, ¡GI am quite ready for Tavistock.¡F

As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the door open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.

¡GYou have a few sheep in the paddock,¡F he said. ¡GWho attends to them?¡F

¡GI do, sir.¡F

¡GHave you noticed anything amiss with them of late?¡F

¡GWell, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone lame, sir.¡F

I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled and rubbed his hands together.

¡GA long shot, Watson; a very long shot,¡F said he, pinching my arm. ¡GGregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic among the sheep. Drive on, coachman!¡F

Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor opinion which he had formed of my companion?s ability, but I saw by the Inspector?s face that his attention had been keenly aroused.

¡GYou consider that to be important?¡F he asked.

¡GExceedingly so.¡F

¡GIs there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?¡F

¡GTo the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.¡F

¡GThe dog did nothing in the night-time.¡F

¡GThat was the curious incident,¡F remarked Sherlock Holmes.

Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for Winchester to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met us by appointment outside the station, and we drove in his drag to the course beyond the town. His face was grave, and his manner was cold in the extreme.

¡GI have seen nothing of my horse,¡F said he.

¡GI suppose that you would know him when you saw him?¡F asked Holmes.

The Colonel was very angry. ¡GI have been on the turf for twenty years, and never was asked such a question as that before,¡F said he. ¡GA child would know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and his mottled off-foreleg.¡F

¡GHow is the betting?¡F

¡GWell, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter, until you can hardly get three to one now.¡F

¡GHum!¡F said Holmes. ¡GSomebody knows something, that is clear.¡F

As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I glanced at the card to see the entries.

Wessex Plate [it ran] 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and five year olds. Second, L300. Third, L200. New course (one mile and five furlongs). Mr. Heath Newton?s The Negro. Red cap. Cinnamon jacket. Colonel Wardlaw?s Pugilist. Pink cap. Blue and black jacket. Lord Backwater?s Desborough. Yellow cap and sleeves. Colonel Ross?s Silver Blaze. Black cap. Red jacket. Duke of Balmoral?s Iris. Yellow and black stripes. Lord Singleford?s Rasper. Purple cap. Black sleeves.

¡GWe scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,¡F said the Colonel. ¡GWhy, what is that? Silver Blaze favorite?¡F

¡GFive to four against Silver Blaze!¡F roared the ring. ¡GFive to four against Silver Blaze! Five to fifteen against Desborough! Five to four on the field!¡F

¡GThere are the numbers up,¡F I cried. ¡GThey are all six there.¡F

¡GAll six there? Then my horse is running,¡F cried the Colonel in great agitation. ¡GBut I don?t see him. My colors have not passed.¡F

¡GOnly five have passed. This must be he.¡F

As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the well-known black and red of the Colonel.

¡GThat?s not my horse,¡F cried the owner. ¡GThat beast has not a white hair upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr. Holmes?¡F

¡GWell, well, let us see how he gets on,¡F said my friend, imperturbably. For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass. ¡GCapital! An excellent start!¡F he cried suddenly. ¡GThere they are, coming round the curve!¡F

From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight. The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable showed to the front. Before they reached us, however, Desborough?s bolt was shot, and the Colonel?s horse, coming away with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival, the Duke of Balmoral?s Iris making a bad third.

¡GIt?s my race, anyhow,¡F gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over his eyes. ¡GI confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it. Don?t you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough, Mr. Holmes?¡F

¡GCertainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go round and have a look at the horse together. Here he is,¡F he continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure, where only owners and their friends find admittance. ¡GYou have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.¡F

¡GYou take my breath away!¡F

¡GI found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over.¡F

¡GMy dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand apologies for having doubted your ability. You have done me a great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John Straker.¡F

¡GI have done so,¡F said Holmes quietly.

The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. ¡GYou have got him! Where is he, then?¡F

¡GHe is here.¡F

¡GHere! Where?¡F

¡GIn my company at the present moment.¡F

The Colonel flushed angrily. ¡GI quite recognize that I am under obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,¡F said he, ¡Gbut I must regard what you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.¡F

Sherlock Holmes laughed. ¡GI assure you that I have not associated you with the crime, Colonel,¡F said he. ¡GThe real murderer is standing immediately behind you.¡F He stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.

¡GThe horse!¡F cried both the Colonel and myself.

¡GYes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was done in self-defense, and that John Straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of your confidence. But there goes the bell, and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.¡F

We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion?s narrative of the events which had occurred at the Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means by which he had unravelled them.

¡GI confess,¡F said he, ¡Gthat any theories which I had formed from the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import. I went to Devonshire with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although, of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached the trainer?s house, that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.¡F

¡GI confess,¡F said the Colonel, ¡Gthat even now I cannot see how it helps us.¡F

¡GIt was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium is by no means tasteless. The flavor is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer?s family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavor. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case, and our attention centers upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing them?

¡GBefore deciding that question I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one whom the dog knew well.

¡GI was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.

¡GAnd they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was found in the dead man?s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse?s ham, and to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play.¡F

¡GVillain! Scoundrel!¡F cried the Colonel.

¡GWe have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take the horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife. It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open air.¡F

¡GI have been blind!¡F cried the Colonel. ¡GOf course that was why he needed the candle, and struck the match.¡F

¡GUndoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not carry other people?s bills about in their pockets. We have most of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of the milliner?s address, and felt that by calling there with Straker?s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical Derbyshire.

¡GFrom that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his flight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it upXwith some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse?s leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make it clear?¡F

¡GWonderful!¡F cried the Colonel. ¡GWonderful! You might have been there!¡F

¡GMy final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practice on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.

¡GWhen I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had recognized Straker as an excellent customer of the name of Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality for expensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this miserable plot.¡F

¡GYou have explained all but one thing,¡F cried the Colonel. ¡GWhere was the horse?¡F

¡GAh, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbors. We must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms, Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which might interest you.¡F
























[In publishing these short sketches based upon the numerous cases in which my companion!|s singular gifts have made us the listeners to, and eventually the actors in, some strange drama, it is only natural that I should dwell rather upon his successes than upon his failures. And this not so much for the sake of his reputation!Xfor, indeed, it was when he was at his wits!| end that his energy and his versatility were most admirable!Xbut because where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded, and that the tale was left forever without a conclusion. Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred, the truth was still discovered. I have noted of some half-dozen cases of the kind; the Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual and that which I am about to recount are the two which present the strongest features of interest.]

Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for exercise!|s sake. Few men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and he seldom bestirred himself save when there was some professional object to be served. Then he was absolutely untiring and indefatigable. That he should have kept himself in training under such circumstances is remarkable, but his diet was usually of the sparest, and his habits were simple to the verge of austerity. Save for the occasional use of cocaine, he had no vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against the monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers uninteresting.

One day in early spring he had so far relaxed as to go for a walk with me in the Park, where the first faint shoots of green were breaking out upon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their five-fold leaves. For two hours we rambled about together, in silence for the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately. It was nearly five before we were back in Baker Street once more.

!¡±Beg pardon, sir,!¡L said our page-boy, as he opened the door. !¡±There!|s been a gentleman here asking for you, sir.!¡L

Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. !¡±So much for afternoon walks!!¡L said he. !¡±Has this gentleman gone, then?!¡L

!¡±Yes, sir.!¡L

!¡±Didn!|t you ask him in?!¡L

!¡±Yes, sir; he came in.!¡L

!¡±How long did he wait?!¡L

!¡±Half an hour, sir. He was a very restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin!| and a-stampin!| all the time he was here. I was waitin!| outside the door, sir, and I could hear him. At last he outs into the passage, and he cries, !¢DIs that man never goin!| to come?!| Those were his very words, sir. !¢DYou!|ll only need to wait a little longer,!| says I. !¢DThen I!|ll wait in the open air, for I feel half choked,!| says he. !¢DI!|ll be back before long.!| And with that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn!|t hold him back.!¡L

!¡±Well, well, you did your best,!¡L said Holmes, as we walked into our room. !¡±It!|s very annoying, though, Watson. I was badly in need of a case, and this looks, from the man!|s impatience, as if it were of importance. Hullo! That!|s not your pipe on the table. He must have left his behind him. A nice old brier with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. I wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in London? Some people think that a fly in it is a sign. Well, he must have been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly.!¡L

!¡±How do you know that he values it highly?!¡L I asked.

!¡±Well, I should put the original cost of the pipe at seven and sixpence. Now it has, you see, been twice mended, once in the wooden stem and once in the amber. Each of these mends, done, as you observe, with silver bands, must have cost more than the pipe did originally. The man must value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new one with the same money.!¡L

!¡±Anything else?!¡L I asked, for Holmes was turning the pipe about in his hand, and staring at it in his peculiar pensive way.

He held it up and tapped on it with his long, thin fore-finger, as a professor might who was lecturing on a bone.

!¡±Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary interest,!¡L said he. !¡±Nothing has more individuality, save perhaps watches and bootlaces. The indications here, however, are neither very marked nor very important. The owner is obviously a muscular man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth, careless in his habits, and with no need to practise economy.!¡L

My friend threw out the information in a very offhand way, but I saw that he cocked his eye at me to see if I had followed his reasoning.

!¡±You think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling pipe,!¡L said I.

!¡±This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce,!¡L Holmes answered, knocking a little out on his palm. !¡±As he might get an excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need to practise economy.!¡L

!¡±And the other points?!¡L

!¡±He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and gas-jets. You can see that it is quite charred all down one side. Of course a match could not have done that. Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe? But you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred. And it is all on the right side of the pipe. From that I gather that he is a left-handed man. You hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how naturally you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. You might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. This has always been held so. Then he has bitten through his amber. It takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good set of teeth, to do that. But if I am not mistaken I hear him upon the stair, so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe to study.!¡L

An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered the room. He was well but quietly dressed in a dark-gray suit, and carried a brown wide-awake in his hand. I should have put him at about thirty, though he was really some years older.

!¡±I beg your pardon,!¡L said he, with some embarrassment; !¡±I suppose I should have knocked. Yes, of course I should have knocked. The fact is that I am a little upset, and you must put it all down to that.!¡L He passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is half dazed, and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair.

!¡±I can see that you have not slept for a night or two,!¡L said Holmes, in his easy, genial way. !¡±That tries a man!|s nerves more than work, and more even than pleasure. May I ask how I can help you?!¡L

!¡±I wanted your advice, sir. I don!|t know what to do and my whole life seems to have gone to pieces.!¡L

!¡±You wish to employ me as a consulting detective?!¡L

!¡±Not that only. I want your opinion as a judicious man!Xas a man of the world. I want to know what I ought to do next. I hope to God you!|ll be able to tell me.!¡L

He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it seemed to me that to speak at all was very painful to him, and that his will all through was overriding his inclinations.

!¡±It!|s a very delicate thing,!¡L said he. !¡±One does not like to speak of one!|s domestic affairs to strangers. It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one!|s wife with two men whom I have never seen before. It!|s horrible to have to do it. But I!|ve got to the end of my tether, and I must have advice.!¡L

!¡±My dear Mr. Grant Munro!X!¡L began Holmes.

Our visitor sprang from his chair. !¡±What!!¡L he cried, !¡±you know my name?!¡L

!¡±If you wish to preserve your incognito,!¡L said Holmes, smiling, !¡±I would suggest that you cease to write your name upon the lining of your hat, or else that you turn the crown towards the person whom you are addressing. I was about to say that my friend and I have listened to a good many strange secrets in this room, and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many troubled souls. I trust that we may do as much for you. Might I beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me with the facts of your case without further delay?!¡L

Our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead, as if he found it bitterly hard. From every gesture and expression I could see that he was a reserved, self-contained man, with a dash of pride in his nature, more likely to hide his wounds than to expose them. Then suddenly, with a fierce gesture of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve to the winds, he began.

!¡±The facts are these, Mr. Holmes,!¡L said he. !¡±I am a married man, and have been so for three years. During that time my wife and I have loved each other as fondly and lived as happily as any two that ever were joined. We have not had a difference, not one, in thought or word or deed. And now, since last Monday, there has suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that there is something in her life and in her thought of which I know as little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street. We are estranged, and I want to know why.

!¡±Now there is one thing that I want to impress upon you before I go any further, Mr. Holmes. Effie loves me. Don!|t let there be any mistake about that. She loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now. I know it. I feel it. I don!|t want to argue about that. A man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him. But there!|s this secret between us, and we can never be the same until it is cleared.!¡L

!¡±Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. Munro,!¡L said Holmes, with some impatience.

!¡±I!|ll tell you what I know about Effie!|s history. She was a widow when I met her first, though quite young!Xonly twenty-five. Her name then was Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when she was young, and lived in the town of Atlanta, where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. They had one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both husband and child died of it. I have seen his death certificate. This sickened her of America, and she came back to live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex. I may mention that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that it returned an average of seven per cent. She had only been six months at Pinner when I met her; we fell in love with each other, and we married a few weeks afterwards.

!¡±I am a hop merchant myself, and as I have an income of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very countrified, considering that it is so close to town. We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at the other side of the field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and I were just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.

!¡±There!|s one thing I ought to tell you before I go further. When we married, my wife made over all her property to me!Xrather against my will, for I saw how awkward it would be if my business affairs went wrong. However, she would have it so, and it was done. Well, about six weeks ago she came to me.

!¡±!|Jack,!| said she, !¢Dwhen you took my money you said that if ever I wanted any I was to ask you for it.!|

!¡±!|Certainly,!| said I. !¢DIt!|s all your own.!|

!¡±!|Well,!| said she, !¢DI want a hundred pounds.!|

!¡±I was a bit staggered at this, for I had imagined it was simply a new dress or something of the kind that she was after.

!¡±!|What on earth for?!| I asked.

!¡±!|Oh,!| said she, in her playful way, !¢Dyou said that you were only my banker, and bankers never ask questions, you know.!|

!¡±!|If you really mean it, of course you shall have the money,!| said I.

!¡±!|Oh, yes, I really mean it.!|

!¡±!|And you won!|t tell me what you want it for?!|

!¡±!|Some day, perhaps, but not just at present, Jack.!|

!¡±So I had to be content with that, though it was the first time that there had ever been any secret between us. I gave her a check, and I never thought any more of the matter. It may have nothing to do with what came afterwards, but I thought it only right to mention it.

!¡±Well, I told you just now that there is a cottage not far from our house. There is just a field between us, but to reach it you have to go along the road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond it is a nice little grove of Scotch firs, and I used to be very fond of strolling down there, for trees are always a neighborly kind of things. The cottage had been standing empty this eight months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty two-storied place, with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. I have stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it would make.

!¡±Well, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll down that way, when I met an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and things lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch. It was clear that the cottage had at last been let. I walked past it, and wondered what sort of folk they were who had come to live so near us. And as I looked I suddenly became aware that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows.

!¡±I don!|t know what there was about that face, Mr. Holmes, but it seemed to send a chill right down my back. I was some little way off, so that I could not make out the features, but there was something unnatural and inhuman about the face. That was the impression that I had, and I moved quickly forwards to get a nearer view of the person who was watching me. But as I did so the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed to have been plucked away into the darkness of the room. I stood for five minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyze my impressions. I could not tell if the face were that of a man or a woman. It had been too far from me for that. But its color was what had impressed me most. It was of a livid chalky white, and with something set and rigid about it which was shockingly unnatural. So disturbed was I that I determined to see a little more of the new inmates of the cottage. I approached and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman with a harsh, forbidding face.

!¡±!|What may you be wantin!|?!| she asked, in a Northern accent.

!¡±!|I am your neighbor over yonder,!| said I, nodding towards my house. !¢DI see that you have only just moved in, so I thought that if I could be of any help to you in any!X!|

!¡±!|Ay, we!|ll just ask ye when we want ye,!| said she, and shut the door in my face. Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked home. All evening, though I tried to think of other things, my mind would still turn to the apparition at the window and the rudeness of the woman. I determined to say nothing about the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly strung woman, and I had no wish that she would share the unpleasant impression which had been produced upon myself. I remarked to her, however, before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied, to which she returned no reply.

!¡±I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. It has been a standing jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the night. And yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure or not I know not, but I slept much more lightly than usual. Half in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle-light, and astonishment held me dumb. She wore an expression such as I had never seen before!Xsuch as I should have thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed as she fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking which could only come from the hinges of the front door. I sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that I was truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the pillow. It was three in the morning. What on this earth could my wife be doing out on the country road at three in the morning?

!¡±I had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing over in my mind and trying to find some possible explanation. The more I thought, the more extraordinary and inexplicable did it appear. I was still puzzling over it when I heard the door gently close again, and her footsteps coming up the stairs.

!¡±!|Where in the world have you been, Effie?!| I asked as she entered.
woman crying on man's shoulder

!¡±She gave a violent start and a kind of gasping cry when I spoke, and that cry and start troubled me more than all the rest, for there was something indescribably guilty about them. My wife had always been a woman of a frank, open nature, and it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her own room, and crying out and wincing when her own husband spoke to her.

!¡±!|You awake, Jack!!| she cried, with a nervous laugh. !¢DWhy, I thought that nothing could awake you.!|

!¡±!|Where have you been?!| I asked, more sternly.

!¡±!|I don!|t wonder that you are surprised,!| said she, and I could see that her fingers were trembling as she undid the fastenings of her mantle. !¢DWhy, I never remember having done such a thing in my life before. The fact is that I felt as though I were choking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air. I really think that I should have fainted if I had not gone out. I stood at the door for a few minutes, and now I am quite myself again.!|

!¡±All the time that she was telling me this story she never once looked in my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual tones. It was evident to me that she was saying what was false. I said nothing in reply, but turned my face to the wall, sick at heart, with my mind filled with a thousand venomous doubts and suspicions. What was it that my wife was concealing from me? Where had she been during that strange expedition? I felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from asking her again after once she had told me what was false. All the rest of the night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory, each more unlikely than the last.

!¡±I should have gone to the City that day, but I was too disturbed in my mind to be able to pay attention to business matters. My wife seemed to be as upset as myself, and I could see from the little questioning glances which she kept shooting at me that she understood that I disbelieved her statement, and that she was at her wits!| end what to do. We hardly exchanged a word during breakfast, and immediately afterwards I went out for a walk, that I might think the matter out in the fresh morning air.

!¡±I went as far as the Crystal Palace, spent an hour in the grounds, and was back in Norbury by one o!|clock. It happened that my way took me past the cottage, and I stopped for an instant to look at the windows, and to see if I could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had looked out at me on the day before. As I stood there, imagine my surprise, Mr. Holmes, when the door suddenly opened and my wife walked out.

!¡±I was struck dumb with astonishment at the sight of her; but my emotions were nothing to those which showed themselves upon her face when our eyes met. She seemed for an instant to wish to shrink back inside the house again; and then, seeing how useless all concealment must be, she came forward, with a very white face and frightened eyes which belied the smile upon her lips.

!¡±!|Ah, Jack,!| she said, !¢DI have just been in to see if I can be of any assistance to our new neighbors. Why do you look at me like that, Jack? You are not angry with me?!|

!¡±!|So,!| said I, !¢Dthis is where you went during the night.!|

!¡±!|What do you mean?!| she cried.

!¡±!|You came here. I am sure of it. Who are these people, that you should visit them at such an hour?!|

!¡±!|I have not been here before.!|

!¡±!|How can you tell me what you know is false?!| I cried. !¢DYour very voice changes as you speak. When have I ever had a secret from you? I shall enter that cottage, and I shall probe the matter to the bottom.!|

!¡±!|No, no, Jack, for God!|s sake!!| she gasped, in uncontrollable emotion. Then, as I approached the door, she seized my sleeve and pulled me back with convulsive strength.

!¡±!|I implore you not to do this, Jack,!| she cried. !¢DI swear that I will tell you everything some day, but nothing but misery can come of it if you enter that cottage.!| Then, as I tried to shake her off, she clung to me in a frenzy of entreaty.

!¡±!|Trust me, Jack!!| she cried. !¢DTrust me only this once. You will never have cause to regret it. You know that I would not have a secret from you if it were not for your own sake. Our whole lives are at stake in this. If you come home with me, all will be well. If you force your way into that cottage, all is over between us.!|

!¡±There was such earnestness, such despair, in her manner that her words arrested me, and I stood irresolute before the door.

!¡±!|I will trust you on one condition, and on one condition only,!| said I at last. !¢DIt is that this mystery comes to an end from now. You are at liberty to preserve your secret, but you must promise me that there shall be no more nightly visits, no more doings which are kept from my knowledge. I am willing to forget those which are passed if you will promise that there shall be no more in the future.!|

!¡±!|I was sure that you would trust me,!| she cried, with a great sigh of relief. !¢DIt shall be just as you wish. Come away!Xoh, come away up to the house.!|

!¡±Still pulling at my sleeve, she led me away from the cottage. As we went I glanced back, and there was that yellow livid face watching us out of the upper window. What link could there be between that creature and my wife? Or how could the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day before be connected with her? It was a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never know ease again until I had solved it.

!¡±For two days after this I stayed at home, and my wife appeared to abide loyally by our engagement, for, as far as I know, she never stirred out of the house. On the third day, however, I had ample evidence that her solemn promise was not enough to hold her back from this secret influence which drew her away from her husband and her duty.

!¡±I had gone into town on that day, but I returned by the 2.40 instead of the 3.36, which is my usual train. As I entered the house the maid ran into the hall with a startled face.

!¡±!|Where is your mistress?!| I asked.

!¡±!|I think that she has gone out for a walk,!| she answered.

!¡±My mind was instantly filled with suspicion. I rushed upstairs to make sure that she was not in the house. As I did so I happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. Then of course I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and had asked the servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once and forever. I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back along the lane, but I did not stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret no longer. I did not even knock when I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into the passage.

!¡±It was all still and quiet upon the ground floor. In the kitchen a kettle was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay coiled up in the basket; but there was no sign of the woman whom I had seen before. I ran into the other room, but it was equally deserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. There was no one at all in the whole house. The furniture and pictures were of the most common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the window of which I had seen the strange face. That was comfortable and elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter flame when I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a full-length photograph of my wife, which had been taken at my request only three months ago.

!¡±I stayed long enough to make certain that the house was absolutely empty. Then I left it, feeling a weight at my heart such as I had never had before. My wife came out into the hall as I entered my house; but I was too hurt and angry to speak with her, and pushing past her, I made my way into my study. She followed me, however, before I could close the door.

!¡±!|I am sorry that I broke my promise, Jack,!| said she; !¢Dbut if you knew all the circumstances I am sure that you would forgive me.!|

!¡±!|Tell me everything, then,!| said I.

!¡±!|I cannot, Jack, I cannot,!| she cried.

!¡±!|Until you tell me who it is that has been living in that cottage, and who it is to whom you have given that photograph, there can never be any confidence between us,!| said I, and breaking away from her, I left the house. That was yesterday, Mr. Holmes, and I have not seen her since, nor do I know anything more about this strange business. It is the first shadow that has come between us, and it has so shaken me that I do not know what I should do for the best. Suddenly this morning it occurred to me that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now, and I place myself unreservedly in your hands. If there is any point which I have not made clear, pray question me about it. But, above all, tell me quickly what I am to do, for this misery is more than I can bear.!¡L

Holmes and I had listened with the utmost interest to this extraordinary statement, which had been delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of a man who is under the influence of extreme emotions. My companion sat silent for some time, with his chin upon his hand, lost in thought.

!¡±Tell me,!¡L said he at last, !¡±could you swear that this was a man!|s face which you saw at the window?!¡L

!¡±Each time that I saw it I was some distance away from it, so that it is impossible for me to say.!¡L

!¡±You appear, however, to have been disagreeably impressed by it.!¡L

!¡±It seemed to be of an unnatural color, and to have a strange rigidity about the features. When I approached, it vanished with a jerk.!¡L

!¡±How long is it since your wife asked you for a hundred pounds?!¡L

!¡±Nearly two months.!¡L

!¡±Have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?!¡L

!¡±No; there was a great fire at Atlanta very shortly after his death, and all her papers were destroyed.!¡L

!¡±And yet she had a certificate of death. You say that you saw it.!¡L

!¡±Yes; she got a duplicate after the fire.!¡L

!¡±Did you ever meet any one who knew her in America?!¡L

!¡±No.!¡L

!¡±Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?!¡L

!¡±No.!¡L

!¡±Or get letters from it?!¡L

!¡±No.!¡L

!¡±Thank you. I should like to think over the matter a little now. If the cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some difficulty. If, on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up easily. Let me advise you, then, to return to Norbury, and to examine the windows of the cottage again. If you have reason to believe that it is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend and me. We shall be with you within an hour of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the business.!¡L

!¡±And if it is still empty?!¡L

!¡±In that case I shall come out to-morrow and talk it over with you. Good-by; and, above all, do not fret until you know that you really have a cause for it.!¡L

!¡±I am afraid that this is a bad business, Watson,!¡L said my companion, as he returned after accompanying Mr. Grant Munro to the door. !¡±What do you make of it?!¡L

!¡±It had an ugly sound,!¡L I answered.

!¡±Yes. There!|s blackmail in it, or I am much mistaken.!¡L

!¡±And who is the blackmailer?!¡L

!¡±Well, it must be the creature who lives in the only comfortable room in the place, and has her photograph above his fireplace. Upon my word, Watson, there is something very attractive about that livid face at the window, and I would not have missed the case for worlds.!¡L

!¡±You have a theory?!¡L

!¡±Yes, a provisional one. But I shall be surprised if it does not turn out to be correct. This woman!|s first husband is in that cottage.!¡L

!¡±Why do you think so?!¡L

!¡±How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it? The facts, as I read them, are something like this: This woman was married in America. Her husband developed some hateful qualities; or shall we say that he contracted some loathsome disease, and became a leper or an imbecile? She flies from him at last, returns to England, changes her name, and starts her life, as she thinks, afresh. She has been married three years, and believes that her position is quite secure, having shown her husband the death certificate of some man whose name she has assumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is discovered by her first husband; or, we may suppose, by some unscrupulous woman who has attached herself to the invalid. They write to the wife, and threaten to come and expose her. She asks for a hundred pounds, and endeavors to buy them off. They come in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually to the wife that there are new-comers in the cottage, she knows in some way that they are her pursuers. She waits until her husband is asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavor to persuade them to leave her in peace. Having no success, she goes again next morning, and her husband meets her, as he has told us, as she comes out. She promises him then not to go there again, but two days afterwards the hope of getting rid of those dreadful neighbors was too strong for her, and she made another attempt, taking down with her the photograph which had probably been demanded from her. In the midst of this interview the maid rushed in to say that the master had come home, on which the wife, knowing that he would come straight down to the cottage, hurried the inmates out at the back door, into the grove of fir-trees, probably, which was mentioned as standing near. In this way he found the place deserted. I shall be very much surprised, however, if it is still so when he reconnoitres it this evening. What do you think of my theory?!¡L

!¡±It is all surmise.!¡L

!¡±But at least it covers all the facts. When new facts come to our knowledge which cannot be covered by it, it will be time enough to reconsider it. We can do nothing more until we have a message from our friend at Norbury.!¡L

But we had not a very long time to wait for that. It came just as we had finished our tea. !¡±The cottage is still tenanted,!¡L it said. !¡±Have seen the face again at the window. Will meet the seven o!|clock train, and will take no steps until you arrive.!¡L

He was waiting on the platform when we stepped out, and we could see in the light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering with agitation.

!¡±They are still there, Mr. Holmes,!¡L said he, laying his hand hard upon my friend!|s sleeve. !¡±I saw lights in the cottage as I came down. We shall settle it now once and for all.!¡L

!¡±What is your plan, then?!¡L asked Holmes, as he walked down the dark tree-lined road.

!¡±I am going to force my way in and see for myself who is in the house. I wish you both to be there as witnesses.!¡L

!¡±You are quite determined to do this, in spite of your wife!|s warning that it is better that you should not solve the mystery?!¡L

!¡±Yes, I am determined.!¡L

!¡±Well, I think that you are in the right. Any truth is better than indefinite doubt. We had better go up at once. Of course, legally, we are putting ourselves hopelessly in the wrong; but I think that it is worth it.!¡L

It was a very dark night, and a thin rain began to fall as we turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on either side. Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could.

!¡±There are the lights of my house,!¡L he murmured, pointing to a glimmer among the trees. !¡±And here is the cottage which I am going to enter.!¡L

We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the building close beside us. A yellow bar falling across the black foreground showed that the door was not quite closed, and one window in the upper story was brightly illuminated. As we looked, we saw a dark blur moving across the blind.

!¡±There is that creature!!¡L cried Grant Munro. !¡±You can see for yourselves that some one is there. Now follow me, and we shall soon know all.!¡L

We approached the door; but suddenly a woman appeared out of the shadow and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. I could not see her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in an attitude of entreaty.

!¡±For God!|s sake, don!|t Jack!!¡L she cried. !¡±I had a presentiment that you would come this evening. Think better of it, dear! Trust me again, and you will never have cause to regret it.!¡L

!¡±I have trusted you too long, Effie,!¡L he cried, sternly. !¡±Leave go of me! I must pass you. My friends and I are going to settle this matter once and forever!!¡L He pushed her to one side, and we followed closely after him. As he threw the door open an old woman ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage, but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon the stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top, and we entered at his heels.

It was a cosey, well-furnished apartment, with two candles burning upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. In the corner, stooping over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. Her face was turned away as we entered, but we could see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that she had long white gloves on. As she whisked round to us, I gave a cry of surprise and horror. The face which she turned towards us was of the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid of any expression. An instant later the mystery was explained. Holmes, with a laugh, passed his hand behind the child!|s ear, a mask peeled off from her countenance, and there was a little coal black negress, with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces. I burst out laughing, out of sympathy with her merriment; but Grant Munro stood staring, with his hand clutching his throat.

!¡±My God!!¡L he cried. !¡±What can be the meaning of this?!¡L

!¡±I will tell you the meaning of it,!¡L cried the lady, sweeping into the room with a proud, set face. !¡±You have forced me, against my own judgment, to tell you, and now we must both make the best of it. My husband died at Atlanta. My child survived.!¡L

!¡±Your child?!¡L

She drew a large silver locket from her bosom. !¡±You have never seen this open.!¡L

!¡±I understood that it did not open.!¡L

She touched a spring, and the front hinged back. There was a portrait within of a man strikingly handsome and intelligent-looking, but bearing unmistakable signs upon his features of his African descent.

!¡±That is John Hebron, of Atlanta,!¡L said the lady, !¡±and a nobler man never walked the earth. I cut myself off from my race in order to wed him, but never once while he lived did I for an instant regret it. It was our misfortune that our only child took after his people rather than mine. It is often so in such matches, and little Lucy is darker far than ever her father was. But dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her mother!|s pet.!¡L The little creature ran across at the words and nestled up against the lady!|s dress. !¡±When I left her in America,!¡L she continued, !¡±it was only because her health was weak, and the change might have done her harm. She was given to the care of a faithful Scotch woman who had once been our servant. Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her as my child. But when chance threw you in my way, Jack, and I learned to love you, I feared to tell you about my child. God forgive me, I feared that I should lose you, and I had not the courage to tell you. I had to choose between you, and in my weakness I turned away from my own little girl. For three years I have kept her existence a secret from you, but I heard from the nurse, and I knew that all was well with her. At last, however, there came an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. I struggled against it, but in vain. Though I knew the danger, I determined to have the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. I sent a hundred pounds to the nurse, and I gave her instructions about this cottage, so that she might come as a neighbor, without my appearing to be in any way connected with her. I pushed my precautions so far as to order her to keep the child in the house during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands so that even those who might see her at the window should not gossip about there being a black child in the neighborhood. If I had been less cautious I might have been more wise, but I was half crazy with fear that you should learn the truth.

!¡±It was you who told me first that the cottage was occupied. I should have waited for the morning, but I could not sleep for excitement, and so at last I slipped out, knowing how difficult it is to awake you. But you saw me go, and that was the beginning of my troubles. Next day you had my secret at your mercy, but you nobly refrained from pursuing your advantage. Three days later, however, the nurse and child only just escaped from the back door as you rushed in at the front one. And now to-night you at last know all, and I ask you what is to become of us, my child and me?!¡L She clasped her hands and waited for an answer.

It was a long ten minutes before Grant Munro broke the silence, and when his answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door.

!¡±We can talk it over more comfortably at home,!¡L said he. !¡±I am not a very good man, Effie, but I think that I am a better one than you have given me credit for being.!¡L

Holmes and I followed them down the lane, and my friend plucked at my sleeve as we came out.

!¡±I think,!¡L said he, !¡±that we shall be of more use in London than in Norbury.!¡L

Not another word did he say of the case until late that night, when he was turning away, with his lighted candle, for his bedroom.

!¡±Watson,!¡L said he, !¡±if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper !¢DNorbury!| in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.!¡L




It was some time before the health of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes recovered from the strain caused by his immense exertions in the spring of ¡D87. The whole question of the Netherland-Sumatra Company and of the colossal schemes of Baron Maupertuis are too recent in the minds of the public, and are too intimately concerned with politics and finance to be fitting subjects for this series of sketches. They led, however, in an indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem which gave my friend an opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh weapon among the many with which he waged his life-long battle against crime.

On referring to my notes I see that it was upon the 14th of April that I received a telegram from Lyons which informed me that Holmes was lying ill in the Hotel Dulong. Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms. Even his iron constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an investigation which had extended over two months, during which period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had more than once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five days at a stretch. Even the triumphant issue of his labors could not save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at a time when Europe was ringing with his name and when his room was literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams I found him a prey to the blackest depression. Even the knowledge that he had succeeded where the police of three countries had failed, and that he had outmanoeuvred at every point the most accomplished swindler in Europe, was insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration.

Three days later we were back in Baker Street together; but it was evident that my friend would be much the better for a change, and the thought of a week of spring time in the country was full of attractions to me also. My old friend, Colonel Hayter, who had come under my professional care in Afghanistan, had now taken a house near Reigate in Surrey, and had frequently asked me to come down to him upon a visit. On the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also. A little diplomacy was needed, but when Holmes understood that the establishment was a bachelor one, and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in with my plans and a week after our return from Lyons we were under the Colonel?s roof. Hayter was a fine old soldier who had seen much of the world, and he soon found, as I had expected, that Holmes and he had much in common.

On the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the Colonel?s gun-room after dinner, Holmes stretched upon the sofa, while Hayter and I looked over his little armory of Eastern weapons.

¡GBy the way,¡F said he suddenly, ¡GI think I?ll take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm.¡F

¡GAn alarm!¡F said I.

¡GYes, we?ve had a scare in this part lately. Old Acton, who is one of our county magnates, had his house broken into last Monday. No great damage done, but the fellows are still at large.¡F

¡GNo clue?¡F asked Holmes, cocking his eye at the Colonel.

¡GNone as yet. But the affair is a petty one, one of our little country crimes, which must seem too small for your attention, Mr. Holmes, after this great international affair.¡F

Holmes waved away the compliment, though his smile showed that it had pleased him.

¡GWas there any feature of interest?¡F

¡GI fancy not. The thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains. The whole place was turned upside down, drawers burst open, and presses ransacked, with the result that an odd volume of Pope?s ¡GHomer,¡F two plated candlesticks, an ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine are all that have vanished.¡F

¡GWhat an extraordinary assortment!¡F I exclaimed.

¡GOh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of everything they could get.¡F

Holmes grunted from the sofa.

¡GThe county police ought to make something of that,¡F said he; ¡Gwhy, it is surely obvious thatX¡F

But I held up a warning finger.

¡GYou are here for a rest, my dear fellow. For Heaven?s sake don?t get started on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds.¡F

Holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the Colonel, and the talk drifted away into less dangerous channels.

It was destined, however, that all my professional caution should be wasted, for next morning the problem obtruded itself upon us in such a way that it was impossible to ignore it, and our country visit took a turn which neither of us could have anticipated. We were at breakfast when the Colonel?s butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him.

¡GHave you heard the news, sir?¡F he gasped. ¡GAt the Cunningham?s sir!¡F

¡GBurglary!¡F cried the Colonel, with his coffee-cup in mid-air.

¡GMurder!¡F

The Colonel whistled. ¡GBy Jove!¡F said he. ¡GWho?s killed, then? The J.P. or his son?¡F

¡GNeither, sir. It was William the coachman. Shot through the heart, sir, and never spoke again.¡F

¡GWho shot him, then?¡F

¡GThe burglar, sir. He was off like a shot and got clean away. He?d just broke in at the pantry window when William came on him and met his end in saving his master?s property.¡F

¡GWhat time?¡F

¡GIt was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.¡F

¡GAh, then, we?ll step over afterwards,¡F said the Colonel, coolly settling down to his breakfast again. ¡GIt?s a baddish business,¡F he added when the butler had gone; ¡Ghe?s our leading man about here, is old Cunningham, and a very decent fellow too. He?ll be cut up over this, for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant. It?s evidently the same villains who broke into Acton?s.¡F

¡GAnd stole that very singular collection,¡F said Holmes, thoughtfully.

¡GPrecisely.¡F

¡GHum! It may prove the simplest matter in the world, but all the same at first glance this is just a little curious, is it not? A gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary the scene of their operations, and not to crack two cribs in the same district within a few days. When you spoke last night of taking precautions I remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in England to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attentionXwhich shows that I have still much to learn.¡F

¡GI fancy it?s some local practitioner,¡F said the Colonel. ¡GIn that case, of course, Acton?s and Cunningham?s are just the places he would go for, since they are far the largest about here.¡F

¡GAnd richest?¡F

¡GWell, they ought to be, but they?ve had a lawsuit for some years which has sucked the blood out of both of them, I fancy. Old Acton has some claim on half Cunningham?s estate, and the lawyers have been at it with both hands.¡F

¡GIf it?s a local villain there should not be much difficulty in running him down,¡F said Holmes with a yawn. ¡GAll right, Watson, I don?t intend to meddle.¡F

¡GInspector Forrester, sir,¡F said the butler, throwing open the door.

The official, a smart, keen-faced young fellow, stepped into the room. ¡GGood-morning, Colonel,¡F said he; ¡GI hope I don?t intrude, but we hear that Mr. Holmes of Baker Street is here.¡F

The Colonel waved his hand towards my friend, and the Inspector bowed.

¡GWe thought that perhaps you would care to step across, Mr. Holmes.¡F

¡GThe fates are against you, Watson,¡F said he, laughing. ¡GWe were chatting about the matter when you came in, Inspector. Perhaps you can let us have a few details.¡F As he leaned back in his chair in the familiar attitude I knew that the case was hopeless.

¡GWe had no clue in the Acton affair. But here we have plenty to go on, and there?s no doubt it is the same party in each case. The man was seen.¡F

¡GAh!¡F

¡GYes, sir. But he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor William Kirwan was fired. Mr. Cunningham saw him from the bedroom window, and Mr. Alec Cunningham saw him from the back passage. It was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. Mr. Cunningham had just got into bed, and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown. They both heard William the coachman calling for help, and Mr. Alec ran down to see what was the matter. The back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. One of them fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge. Mr. Cunningham, looking out of his bedroom, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of him at once. Mr. Alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man, and so the villain got clean away. Beyond the fact that he was a middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no personal clue; but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out.¡F

¡GWhat was this William doing there? Did he say anything before he died?¡F

¡GNot a word. He lives at the lodge with his mother, and as he was a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there. Of course this Acton business has put every one on their guard. The robber must have just burst open the doorXthe lock has been forcedXwhen William came upon him.¡F

¡GDid William say anything to his mother before going out?¡F

¡GShe is very old and deaf, and we can get no information from her. The shock has made her half-witted, but I understand that she was never very bright. There is one very important circumstance, however. Look at this!¡F

He took a small piece of torn paper from a note-book and spread it out upon his knee.

¡GThis was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man. It appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet. You will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate. You see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer. It reads almost as though it were an appointment.¡F

Holmes took up the scrap of paper, a fac-simile of which is here reproduced.
at quarter to twelve learn what may

¡GPresuming that it is an appointment,¡F continued the Inspector, ¡Git is of course a conceivable theory that this William KirwanXthough he had the reputation of being an honest man, may have been in league with the thief. He may have met him there, may even have helped him to break in the door, and then they may have fallen out between themselves.¡F

¡GThis writing is of extraordinary interest,¡F said Holmes, who had been examining it with intense concentration. ¡GThese are much deeper waters than I had thought.¡F He sank his head upon his hands, while the Inspector smiled at the effect which his case had had upon the famous London specialist.

¡GYour last remark,¡F said Holmes, presently, ¡Gas to the possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar and the servant, and this being a note of appointment from one to the other, is an ingenious and not entirely impossible supposition. But this writing opens upX¡F He sank his head into his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest thought. When he raised his face again, I was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with color, and his eyes as bright as before his illness. He sprang to his feet with all his old energy.

¡GI?ll tell you what,¡F said he, ¡GI should like to have a quiet little glance into the details of this case. There is something in it which fascinates me extremely. If you will permit me, Colonel, I will leave my friend Watson and you, and I will step round with the Inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancies of mine. I will be with you again in half an hour.¡F

An hour and half had elapsed before the Inspector returned alone.

¡GMr. Holmes is walking up and down in the field outside,¡F said he. ¡GHe wants us all four to go up to the house together.¡F

¡GTo Mr. Cunningham?s?¡F

¡GYes, sir.¡F

¡GWhat for?¡F

The Inspector shrugged his shoulders. ¡GI don?t quite know, sir. Between ourselves, I think Mr. Holmes has not quite got over his illness yet. He?s been behaving very queerly, and he is very much excited.¡F

¡GI don?t think you need alarm yourself,¡F said I. ¡GI have usually found that there was method in his madness.¡F

¡GSome folks might say there was madness in his method,¡F muttered the Inspector. ¡GBut he?s all on fire to start, Colonel, so we had best go out if you are ready.¡F

We found Holmes pacing up and down in the field, his chin sunk upon his breast, and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets.

¡GThe matter grows in interest,¡F said he. ¡GWatson, your country-trip has been a distinct success. I have had a charming morning.¡F

¡GYou have been up to the scene of the crime, I understand,¡F said the Colonel.

¡GYes; the Inspector and I have made quite a little reconnaissance together.¡F

¡GAny success?¡F

¡GWell, we have seen some very interesting things. I?ll tell you what we did as we walk. First of all, we saw the body of this unfortunate man. He certainly died from a revolver wound as reported.¡F

¡GHad you doubted it, then?¡F

¡GOh, it is as well to test everything. Our inspection was not wasted. We then had an interview with Mr. Cunningham and his son, who were able to point out the exact spot where the murderer had broken through the garden-hedge in his flight. That was of great interest.¡F

¡GNaturally.¡F

¡GThen we had a look at this poor fellow?s mother. We could get no information from her, however, as she is very old and feeble.¡F

¡GAnd what is the result of your investigations?¡F

¡GThe conviction that the crime is a very peculiar one. Perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure. I think that we are both agreed, Inspector that the fragment of paper in the dead man?s hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour of his death written upon it, is of extreme importance.¡F

¡GIt should give a clue, Mr. Holmes.¡F

¡GIt does give a clue. Whoever wrote that note was the man who brought William Kirwan out of his bed at that hour. But where is the rest of that sheet of paper?¡F

¡GI examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it,¡F said the Inspector.

¡GIt was torn out of the dead man?s hand. Why was some one so anxious to get possession of it? Because it incriminated him. And what would he do with it? Thrust it into his pocket, most likely, never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse. If we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery.¡F

¡GYes, but how can we get at the criminal?s pocket before we catch the criminal?¡F

¡GWell, well, it was worth thinking over. Then there is another obvious point. The note was sent to William. The man who wrote it could not have taken it; otherwise, of course, he might have delivered his own message by word of mouth. Who brought the note, then? Or did it come through the post?¡F

¡GI have made inquiries,¡F said the Inspector. ¡GWilliam received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday. The envelope was destroyed by him.¡F

¡GExcellent!¡F cried Holmes, clapping the Inspector on the back. ¡GYou?ve seen the postman. It is a pleasure to work with you. Well, here is the lodge, and if you will come up, Colonel, I will show you the scene of the crime.¡F

We passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old Queen Anne house, which bears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the door. Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road. A constable was standing at the kitchen door.

¡GThrow the door open, officer,¡F said Holmes. ¡GNow, it was on those stairs that young Mr. Cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are. Old Mr. Cunningham was at that windowXthe second on the leftXand he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush. Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man. The ground is very hard, you see, and there are no marks to guide us.¡F As he spoke two men came down the garden path, from round the angle of the house. The one was an elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose bright, smiling expression and showy dress were in strange contract with the business which had brought us there.

¡GStill at it, then?¡F said he to Holmes. ¡GI thought you Londoners were never at fault. You don?t seem to be so very quick, after all.¡F

¡GAh, you must give us a little time,¡F said Holmes good-humoredly.

¡GYou?ll want it,¡F said young Alec Cunningham. ¡GWhy, I don?t see that we have any clue at all.¡F

¡GThere?s only one,¡F answered the Inspector. ¡GWe thought that if we could only findXGood heavens, Mr. Holmes! What is the matter?¡F
man accidentally tipping table over

My poor friend?s face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression. His eyes rolled upwards, his features writhed in agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground. Horrified at the suddenness and severity of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where he lay back in a large chair, and breathed heavily for some minutes. Finally, with a shamefaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more.

¡GWatson would tell you that I have only just recovered from a severe illness,¡F he explained. ¡GI am liable to these sudden nervous attacks.¡F

¡GShall I send you home in my trap?¡F asked old Cunningham.

¡GWell, since I am here, there is one point on which I should like to feel sure. We can very easily verify it.¡F

¡GWhat was it?¡F

¡GWell, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow William was not before, but after, the entrance of the burglary into the house. You appear to take it for granted that, although the door was forced, the robber never got in.¡F

¡GI fancy that is quite obvious,¡F said Mr. Cunningham, gravely. ¡GWhy, my son Alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly have heard any one moving about.¡F

¡GWhere was he sitting?¡F

¡GI was smoking in my dressing-room.¡F

¡GWhich window is that?¡F

¡GThe last on the left next my father?s.¡F

¡GBoth of your lamps were lit, of course?¡F

¡GUndoubtedly.¡F

¡GThere are some very singular points here,¡F said Holmes, smiling. ¡GIs it not extraordinary that a burglaryXand a burglar who had had some previous experienceXshould deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot?¡F

¡GHe must have been a cool hand.¡F

¡GWell, of course, if the case were not an odd one we should not have been driven to ask you for an explanation,¡F said young Mr. Alec. ¡GBut as to your ideas that the man had robbed the house before William tackled him, I think it a most absurd notion. Wouldn?t we have found the place disarranged, and missed the things which he had taken?¡F

¡GIt depends on what the things were,¡F said Holmes. ¡GYou must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own. Look, for example, at the queer lot of things which he took from Acton?sXwhat was it?Xa ball of string, a letter-weight, and I don?t know what other odds and ends.¡F

¡GWell, we are quite in your hands, Mr. Holmes,¡F said old Cunningham. ¡GAnything which you or the Inspector may suggest will most certainly be done.¡F

¡GIn the first place,¡F said Holmes, ¡GI should like you to offer a rewardXcoming from yourself, for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things cannot be done too promptly. I have jotted down the form here, if you would not mind signing it. Fifty pounds was quite enough, I thought.¡F

¡GI would willingly give five hundred,¡F said the J.P., taking the slip of paper and the pencil which Holmes handed to him. ¡GThis is not quite correct, however,¡F he added, glancing over the document.

¡GI wrote it rather hurriedly.¡F

¡GYou see you begin, ¡DWhereas, at about a quarter to one on Tuesday morning an attempt was made,? and so on. It was at a quarter to twelve, as a matter of fact.¡F

I was pained at the mistake, for I knew how keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind. It was his specialty to be accurate as to fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this one little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from being himself. He was obviously embarrassed for an instant, while the Inspector raised his eyebrows, and Alec Cunningham burst into a laugh. The old gentleman corrected the mistake, however, and handed the paper back to Holmes.

¡GGet it printed as soon as possible,¡F he said; ¡GI think your idea is an excellent one.¡F

Holmes put the slip of paper carefully away into his pocket-book.

¡GAnd now,¡F said he, ¡Git really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house together and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him.¡F

Before entering, Holmes made an examination of the door which had been forced. It was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in, and the lock forced back with it. We could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in.

¡GYou don?t use bars, then?¡F he asked.

¡GWe have never found it necessary.¡F

¡GYou don?t keep a dog?¡F

¡GYes, but he is chained on the other side of the house.¡F

¡GWhen do the servants go to bed?¡F

¡GAbout ten.¡F

¡GI understand that William was usually in bed also at that hour.¡F

¡GYes.¡F

¡GIt is singular that on this particular night he should have been up. Now, I should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house, Mr. Cunningham.¡F

A stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens branching away from it, led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the house. It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall. Out of this landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms, including those of Mr. Cunningham and his son. Holmes walked slowly, taking keen note of the architecture of the house. I could tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet I could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him.

¡GMy good sir,¡F said Mr. Cunningham with some impatience, ¡Gthis is surely very unnecessary. That is my room at the end of the stairs, and my son?s is the one beyond it. I leave it to your judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up here without disturbing us.¡F

¡GYou must try round and get on a fresh scent, I fancy,¡F said the son with a rather malicious smile.

¡GStill, I must ask you to humor me a little further. I should like, for example, to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front. This, I understand is your son?s room¡FXhe pushed open the doorX¡Fand that, I presume, is the dressing-room in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given. Where does the window of that look out to?¡F He stepped across the bedroom, pushed open the door, and glanced round the other chamber.

¡GI hope that you are satisfied now?¡F said Mr. Cunningham, tartly.

¡GThank you, I think I have seen all that I wished.¡F

¡GThen if it is really necessary we can go into my room.¡F

¡GIf it is not too much trouble.¡F

The J. P. shrugged his shoulders, and led the way into his own chamber, which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room. As we moved across it in the direction of the window, Holmes fell back until he and I were the last of the group. Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we passed it Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room.

¡GYou?ve done it now, Watson,¡F said he, coolly. ¡GA pretty mess you?ve made of the carpet.¡F

I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit, understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself. The others did the same, and set the table on its legs again.

¡GHullo!¡F cried the Inspector, ¡Gwhere?s he got to?¡F

Holmes had disappeared.

¡GWait here an instant,¡F said young Alec Cunningham. ¡GThe fellow is off his head, in my opinion. Come with me, father, and see where he has got to!¡F

They rushed out of the room, leaving the Inspector, the Colonel, and me staring at each other.

¡G¡DPon my word, I am inclined to agree with Master Alec,¡F said the official. ¡GIt may be the effect of this illness, but it seems to me thatX¡F

His words were cut short by a sudden scream of ¡GHelp! Help! Murder!¡F With a thrill I recognized the voice of that of my friend. I rushed madly from the room on to the landing. The cries, which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate shouting, came from the room which we had first visited. I dashed in, and on into the dressing-room beyond. The two Cunninghams were bending over the prostrate figure of Sherlock Holmes, the younger clutching his throat with both hands, while the elder seemed to be twisting one of his wrists. In an instant the three of us had torn them away from him, and Holmes staggered to his feet, very pale and evidently greatly exhausted.

¡GArrest these men, Inspector,¡F he gasped.

¡GOn what charge?¡F

¡GThat of murdering their coachman, William Kirwan.¡F

The Inspector stared about him in bewilderment. ¡GOh, come now, Mr. Holmes,¡F said he at last, ¡GI?m sure you don?t really mean toX¡F

¡GTut, man, look at their faces!¡F cried Holmes, curtly.

Never certainly have I seen a plainer confession of guilt upon human countenances. The older man seemed numbed and dazed with a heavy, sullen expression upon his strongly-marked face. The son, on the other hand, had dropped all that jaunty, dashing style which had characterized him, and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome features. The Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door, he blew his whistle. Two of his constables came at the call.

¡GI have no alternative, Mr. Cunningham,¡F said he. ¡GI trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake, but you can see thatXAh, would you? Drop it!¡F He struck out with his hand, and a revolver which the younger man was in the act of cocking clattered down upon the floor.

¡GKeep that,¡F said Holmes, quietly putting his foot upon it; ¡Gyou will find it useful at the trial. But this is what we really wanted.¡F He held up a little crumpled piece of paper.

¡GThe remainder of the sheet!¡F cried the Inspector.

¡GPrecisely.¡F

¡GAnd where was it?¡F

¡GWhere I was sure it must be. I?ll make the whole matter clear to you presently. I think, Colonel, that you and Watson might return now, and I will be with you again in an hour at the furthest. The Inspector and I must have a word with the prisoners, but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time.¡F

Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for about one o?clock he rejoined us in the Colonel?s smoking-room. He was accompanied by a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.

¡GI wished Mr. Acton to be present while I demonstrated this small matter to you,¡F said Holmes, ¡Gfor it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as I am.¡F

¡GOn the contrary,¡F answered the Colonel, warmly, ¡GI consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working. I confess that they quite surpass my expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account for your result. I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.¡F

¡GI am afraid that my explanation may disillusion you but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from my friend Watson or from any one who might take an intelligent interest in them. But, first, as I am rather shaken by the knocking about which I had in the dressing-room, I think that I shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, Colonel. My strength had been rather tried of late.¡F

¡GI trust that you had no more of those nervous attacks.¡F

Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily. ¡GWe will come to that in its turn,¡F said he. ¡GI will lay an account of the case before you in its due order, showing you the various points which guided me in my decision. Pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is not perfectly clear to you.

¡GIt is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which vital. Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated. Now, in this case there was not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the key of the whole matter must be looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man?s hand.

¡GBefore going into this, I would draw your attention to the fact that, if Alec Cunningham?s narrative was correct, and if the assailant, after shooting William Kirwan, had instantly fled, then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the dead man?s hand. But if it was not he, it must have been Alec Cunningham himself, for by the time that the old man had descended several servants were upon the scene. The point is a simple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter. Now, I make a point of never having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so, in the very first stage of the investigation, I found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by Mr. Alec Cunningham.

¡GAnd now I made a very careful examination of the corner of paper which the Inspector had submitted to us. It was at once clear to me that it formed part of a very remarkable document. Here it is. Do you not now observe something very suggestive about it?¡F

¡GIt has a very irregular look,¡F said the Colonel.

¡GMy dear sir,¡F cried Holmes, ¡Gthere cannot be the least doubt in the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate words. When I draw your attention to the strong t?s of ¡Dat? and ¡Dto?, and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of ¡Dquarter? and ¡Dtwelve,? you will instantly recognize the fact. A very brief analysis of these four words would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the ¡Dlearn? and the ¡Dmaybe? are written in the stronger hand, and the ¡Dwhat? in the weaker.¡F

¡GBy Jove, it?s as clear as day!¡F cried the Colonel. ¡GWhy on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?¡F

¡GObviously the business was a bad one, and one of the men who distrusted the other was determined that, whatever was done, each should have an equal hand in it. Now, of the two men, it is clear that the one who wrote the ¡Dat? and ¡Dto? was the ringleader.¡F

¡GHow do you get at that?¡F

¡GWe might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compared with the other. But we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it. If you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to fill up. These blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see that the second man had a squeeze to fit his ¡Dquarter? in between the ¡Dat? and the ¡Dto,? showing that the latter were already written. The man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the man who planned the affair.¡F

¡GExcellent!¡F cried Mr. Acton.

¡GBut very superficial,¡F said Holmes. ¡GWe come now, however, to a point which is of importance. You may not be aware that the deduction of a man?s age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts. In normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. I say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth. In this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still retains its legibility although the t?s have begun to lose their crossing, we can say that the one was a young man and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.¡F

¡GExcellent!¡F cried Mr. Acton again.

¡GThere is a further point, however, which is subtler and of greater interest. There is something in common between these hands. They belong to men who are blood-relatives. It may be most obvious to you in the Greek e?s, but to me there are many small points which indicate the same thing. I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing. I am only, of course, giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper. There were twenty-three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you. They all tend to deepen the impression upon my mind that the Cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter.

¡GHaving got so far, my next step was, of course, to examine into the details of the crime, and to see how far they would help us. I went up to the house with the Inspector, and saw all that was to be seen. The wound upon the dead man was, as I was able to determine with absolute confidence, fired from a revolver at the distance of something over four yards. There was no powder-blackening on the clothes. Evidently, therefore, Alec Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired. Again, both father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road. At that point, however, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist at the bottom. As there were no indications of bootmarks about this ditch, I was absolutely sure not only that the Cunninghams had again lied, but that there had never been any man upon the scene at all.

¡GAnd now I have to consider the motive of this singular crime. To get at this, I endeavored first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at Mr. Acton?s. I understood, from something which the Colonel told us, that a lawsuit had been going on between you, Mr. Acton, and the Cunninghams. Of course, it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case.¡F

¡GPrecisely so,¡F said Mr. Acton. ¡GThere can be no possible doubt as to their intentions. I have the clearest claim upon half of their present estate, and if they could have found a single paperXwhich, fortunately, was in the strong-box of my solicitorsXthey would undoubtedly have crippled our case.¡F

¡GThere you are,¡F said Holmes, smiling. ¡GIt was a dangerous, reckless attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man?s hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

¡GThe Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation.

¡GGood heavens!¡F cried the Colonel, laughing, ¡Gdo you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?¡F

¡GSpeaking professionally, it was admirably done,¡F cried I, looking in amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new phase of his astuteness.

¡GIt is an art which is often useful,¡F said he. ¡GWhen I recovered I managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word ¡Dtwelve,? so that I might compare it with the ¡Dtwelve? upon the paper.¡F

¡GOh, what an ass I have been!¡F I exclaimed.

¡GI could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness,¡F said Holmes, laughing. ¡GI was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I had hardly got the paper, howeverXwhich was, as I had expected, in one of themXwhen the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man?s grip on my throat now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate.

¡GI had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else?s brains if he could have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr. Acton?s, and having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of exposure, to levy blackmail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused.¡F

¡GAnd the note?¡F I asked.

Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.
If you will only come around at quarter to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much surprise you and may be of greatest service to you and also to Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyong upon the matter

¡GIt is very much the sort of thing that I expected,¡F said he. ¡GOf course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The results shows that the trap was skillfully baited. I am sure that you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p?s and in the tails of the g?s. The absence of the i-dots in the old man?s writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly return much invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow.¡F
